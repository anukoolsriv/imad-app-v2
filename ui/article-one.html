                When my time comes
                Forget the wrong that I've done
                Help me leave behind some
                Reasons to be missed
                Dont resent me
                And when you're feeling empty
                Keep me in your memory
                Leave out all the rest

                I remembered black skies
                The lightning all around me
                I remembered each flash
                As time began to blur
                Like a strtling sign
                The fate had finally found me
                And my voice was all i heard
                That i get what i deserved
            </p>
